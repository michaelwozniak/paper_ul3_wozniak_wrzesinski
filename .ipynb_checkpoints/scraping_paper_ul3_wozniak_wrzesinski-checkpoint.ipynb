    "In practice, downloading the necessary information for this analysis was not trivial. It requires a three-step approach. First, the HTML code of Polish film rankings for the years 2010-2019 was downloaded from the Filmweb using the Selenium library (this is dynamic page). Then the direct links to the movies were extracted from the above code (using BeautifulSoup). After modifying these links, they redirected directly to the cast of the given film. Eventually, the cast was scraped per film. Finally we obtained a matrix with 570 rows (movies) and their corresponding actors."
